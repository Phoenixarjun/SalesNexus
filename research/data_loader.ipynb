    "\n",
    "To **predict daily sales** for each item across stores, enabling:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Dynamic Pricing** — Adjust pricing based on demand and promotions\n",
    "✅ **Inventory Optimization** — Reduce waste, prevent stockouts\n",
    "✅ **Better Profitability** — Minimize surplus, maximize sales efficiency\n",

    "* Respond to **regional differences** across stores\n",
    "* Adjust to **external influences** (economic changes, events)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resulting Problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overstocking ➔ Increased waste and holding costs\n",
    "* Understocking ➔ Missed sales and dissatisfied customers\n",
    "* Suboptimal pricing ➔ Reduced margins and competitive disadvantage\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "Develop a robust sales forecasting system that predicts future sales per item, per store, and allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automated, data-driven pricing adjustments\n",
    "* Smarter inventory planning\n",
    "* Insights into sales drivers (trend, seasonality, promotions)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increase Profitability**: Minimize waste and surplus inventory.\n",
    "* **Optimize Operations**: Reduce storage and logistics costs.\n",
    "* **Better Experience**: Improve product availability and pricing precision for customers.\n",
